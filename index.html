<h1>Welcome to Michigan: America's high five!</h1>

    <p>Michigan, the only state in the U.S. that's split into two distinct peninsulas, is a unique and vibrant destination. Surrounded by four of the five Great Lakes, Michigan boasts more coastline than any state in the continental U.S., offering an abundance of water-based activities from boating and fishing to exploring historic lighthouses and pristine beaches.</p>
    <p>The Lower Peninsula, often likened to a mitten due to its shape, is home to bustling cities like Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Lansing, the state capital. Detroit, known as the "Motor City," has a rich automotive history and is a hub for innovation, culture, and music. Grand Rapids, the second-largest city, is renowned for its vibrant arts scene and numerous craft breweries.</p>
    <p>The Upper Peninsula, or "U.P." as locals call it, is a nature lover's paradise. With dense forests, stunning waterfalls, and rugged terrain, it's perfect for outdoor adventures like hiking, camping, and snowmobiling. The U.P. is not only home to myself, but also home to the iconic Mackinac Bridge, which connects the two peninsulas and stands as a testament to Michigan's engineering prowess.</p>   
    <p>Beyond its natural beauty and vibrant cities, Michigan is known for its rich history and diverse culture. From the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn to the iconic Motown sound that emerged from Detroit, there's something for everyone to discover.</p>
    <p>Whether you're exploring the bustling streets of Detroit, enjoying a day on the shores of Lake Huron, or taking in the serene landscapes of the Upper Peninsula, Michigan offers an experience that is as diverse as its geography. We invite you to explore the Great Lakes State and discover all it has to offer.</p>
